title: 'Needy Humans'
---

One thing was exceedingly clear to anyone, human or not, who lived in Vermillion: humans are the neediest of creatures.

They needed clean air, water, food, indoor plumbing with toilets and sinks. To beings who needed only an outlet to charge their batteries, this seemed to be quite a few requirements.

Beyond those animal needs, they also needed to touch things all the time. They were always going on about how things are soft or warm or wet. While androids could detect these things, they didnâ€™t understand why humans were so obsessed with them. Then again, their sense of touch was rudimentary: they knew if they were touching something or not, and could sense temperature or pressure, but they did not understand why humans felt such pleasure or displeasure from such things.

What constructs found especially strange and at times hilarious, was the overwhelming emotion humans seemed to display around mundane things like eating food, sitting on a soft chair, or procreating. 

Humans were weird.
