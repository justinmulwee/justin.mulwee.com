title: 'A Place For Constructs'
---

Nobody wanted to live in Vermilion. There were at least three main reasons for this.

First, very few humans lived there, and the vast majority of it was abandoned. It was therefore a cesspool of crime, since it was an area relatively out of the light of the government and police.

Second, the Factory Incident took place here. Humans didn’t want to live here just like they didn’t want to buy houses where the previous tenants were murdered. Vermilion was known as a ghost town, both in the sense of being empty, and in the sense of evoking an eerie feeling as if it were haunted by the ghosts of humans who used to live there.

Third, it was considered a place for constructs, not humans. Even those progressive young humans who might like the idea of living among so many robots, were turned away by practical concerns. Though some of Vermilion had been repaired after the Factory Incident, it had been repaired for the most part to suit the needs of its main residents: Constructs. The constructs settling here found that there were many infrastructure elements they simply didn’t need to repair or maintain due to their lack of bodily needs.

they did not need grocery stores or restaurants, or supply lines to import food. They did not need toilets, and since sanitation was unimportant, they did not necessarily need sinks or running water at all. Kitchens had their appliances removed and scrapped and converted into other rooms. While in Vermilion, simply finding a proper place to use the restroom could be a challenge. There were human establishments, however: there were human-oriented apartments, a few restaurants and a solitary grocery store. Humans tended to cluster around these places, while Constructs were more than happy to live on dark streets with no water or food.

Many of the Constructs lived further from the main street, where no plumbing worked, and there was really no remaining infrastructure at all, except a precarious power grid, an absolute necessity for constructs. But clean air was not required. So there was an area permanently flooded with toxic gas underground, and constructs lived here happily. In fact, this region proved something of a gathering place for constructs who wished not to be near humans at all.  They could have fixed the leak long ago, but word on the street was its residence liked the fact that humans could not even enter the area.

This area was called The Miasma.
