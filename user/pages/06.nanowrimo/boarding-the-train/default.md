title: 'Boarding the train'

Despite living in Vermilion for years, Claire rarely had any occasion to visit the terminal since she arrived. But she had an appointment to keep.

Since Level 4 was essentially a roof of a tall building, one could see for miles on a clear day. Though it was foggy, the fog was below the level, such that from the edge of level 4 beyond the terminal, one could look passed the railing and see the fog just below, like a layer of cotton. And far beyond, passed the vast emptiness that separated the district from everything else, she could just make out the skyline of an otherworldly place.

The buildings were tall and geometric, with the orange light of sunrise reflecting off their glassy outer walls.  It was full of light from the many inhabited buildings and street lamps there, in great contrast to where she lived, which had a dimness to it even during the day due to the overhead ceiling separating the levels.

This, in the distance, was Haut, a district most people in Dessous had only heard about. Technically it was part of the same city, and there was no restriction on travel between its districts, nor was the price of train unreasonable. But nobody Claire knew had any reason to go there. What was the point of visiting a city where a mere evening dinner or a night at a hotel cost a month’s wages? 

Still, there was something exciting about seeing such a place, if only to look around. She boarded the train.

The deep electric hum of magnets filled the cabin as the train began to lurch forward, and then it became quiet again. Despite being an old train on an old track, it was quiet and smooth, not so much as a bump. A testament to its design. She of course was in the coach section. She’d heard that the first class cabin was practically like a narrow mansion, with fancy waiters bringing one exotic delicacies. Although this sounded wonderful, Claire was not one overly consumed with the worldly pleasures of the rich. Her cabin was austere but clean and comfortable and, since few people had occasion to go to Haut, it was relatively empty. The few here were well dressed people she did not recognize. Most likely tourists returning home, she thought.

She chose a window seat in an empty row. As the train accelerated, she saw the tallest buildings of the district pass and then disappear, giving way to a much different view: an uneven scrubland with peculiar rock formations. No roads, no buildings. Though some might have said it looked empty and inhospitable, she appreciated the change of scenery. The simplicity of a place that was not overun with people and technology. After enjoying the view for a while, she opened her book again.
