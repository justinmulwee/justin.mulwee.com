title: Leftovers
---

The teen couple who had been talking walked out. While the boy had devoured his food, the girl’s burger had only one bite out of it. Claire seized the opportunity, took the plate back to the kitchen, and ate the burger. 

This was how Claire normally ate most of her meals. Because of the lack of humans, there was only one grocery store in Vermilion and the prices were high. They were high enough that it wasn’t much more expensive to eat out. So diners became a gathering place for the sparse humans. 

Claire was thankful she worked at a diner, which meant she could subsist almost entirely on free leftovers. And while the diner’s food wasn’t great, it wasn’t bad either.

At home her fridge was sparse, but it always had one or two take out bags from the diner.
