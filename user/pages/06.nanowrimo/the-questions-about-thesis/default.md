title: 'The Questions About THESIS'
---

Much of the speculation about THESIS has been about the nature of the relationships between its reclusive alleged team members. There are many questions at work here, which this book intends to explore.

Crane, a computer scientist, who somehow formed an unlikely friendship with avant-garde artist Clemens, who by all accounts basically had no friends.

Dr. Eleanor Frey, who may or may not have had a romantic relationship with Crane, and also seemed to have some unexplained animosity toward Clemens.

Whether or not Shu Leeâ€™s controversial work in developmental psychology formed a basis for the learning patterns of the THESIS constructs we know today.

The alleged conflict among team members as to whether or not Constructs should be able to reproduce.

Why and how Crane and Clemens disappeared and lastly, why none of the remaining team members seem to want to talk about the company at all.
