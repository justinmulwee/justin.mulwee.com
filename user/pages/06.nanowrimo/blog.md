November is national novel writing month, and I'll be drafting a science fiction novel tentatively titled *THESIS*. Now as Hemingway said, first draft of anything is shit. Nothing on this page will be worth reading. It'll be full of terrible dialog, spelling errors, and will just be generally terrible. I'm only putting it online to create for myself a threat of public failure if I *don't* write. But if you do take a peek and think it looks like I have no standards here, you're right, I don't. There is no such thing as good writing, only good rewriting.
