Dear Claire,

I hope you’re okay. When you first told me you were moving to Ground Zero I couldn’t believe it. Like many, I’d heard that it was a place where humans are killed routinely. I know that was probably just the sensationalist media, but I still worry.

Are there a lot of humans there? I know the place is mostly empty, but I know there must be real people here and there. I hope you find a nice boy to settle down with. 

Just promise me you’ll stay away from the robot neighborhoods. It’s not safe for people there.  I know you just think I’m paranoid but when you’re older you’ll understand.

The day your parents called me and told me not to send you home.  It’s something I’ll never forget. I can’t imagine going back to that place now. Maybe you feel like you can find some kind of closure by living in that place. I just don’t want you to end up like them. 

If you think of it, pray for your uncle Hank. He’s having heart problems again. I keep trying to convince him to get that prosthetic heart, but he’s still scared of it. I know it probably surprises you I’m trying to convince him to get it. I’m not as much of a luddite as you think, I just worry about you. Somebody’s got to.

Take care,

Love, Eleanor
