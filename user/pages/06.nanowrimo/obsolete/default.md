title: Obsolete

One reason the Republic was, and still is so afraid of Dr. Crane’s work, is not just the work itself and its results. It’s also his ideas. Ever since people began to work seriously on the principles of artificial intelligence, there have been groups who warned against the technological singularity — basically, the point at which there is an AI smarter than us, capable of reprogramming itself and/or creating other AI. At this point, humans would completely lose control of the development of artificial intelligence and at some point be unable even to understand it. We could get to a point where AI are as far above us as we are above dogs, or ants. Eventually, they would become like gods to us.

This scenario was once considered the realm of paranoia. But this concern has leaped to the forefront as human-like AI has been introduced to the public life quite suddenly. People are understandably afraid of what’s next.

What people are most afraid of is the idea that a superior AI will become the dominant “species” on earth, especially since this could happen in a relatively short time, relegating humans to… what? That’s uncertain. Second class citizens? Pets? Ants in an ant farm?

What really frightened people about Dr. Crane is, not only did he see this as a possible outcome of his work, he saw it as an inevitable one and, maybe even a positive one worth working toward.

His argument was essentially that humans are becoming obsolete, or as he put it “biologically outdated.” Humans, he argued, have probably been outdated for the last 100 years. His doctoral thesis for his anthropology degree basically argued this in detail. The gist of his argument is as follows.

1. Most human behavior is driven by biological drives.

2. Our “hunger” drive is outdated. Almost no one has a paying job involving a day of physical labor anymore, but our tastes are geared toward high calorie intake (fat and sugar) resulting in obesity epidemic.

3. Our sex drive is outdated. Its rooted in the evolutionary need to procreate and to perpetuate one’s genetic material. However, the planet will shortly be overpopulated, and many people born today are from genetically constructed zygotes, resulting in less genetic disease. 

4. Likewise what we find attractive is outdated. In women, breasts and hips are associated with childbearing, not with character, intelligence or anything to do with suitable life partners. In men, traits like muscles and height are preferred, but these have nothing to do anymore even with traditionally masculine values like societal status, power, ability to provide and protect.

5. A major motive for much of the evil in the world is money, but what is the end goal of money? Sure, power and influence is a major factor for some, but for others it revolves around physical sensations. What luxuries do people buy? Chocolates, couches, silk shirts, hot tubs and swimming pools, fine foods they don’t have to cook, alcohol, drugs, prostitutes. All physical sensations. While money will always hold power, its power would not be so great if there weren’t an ongoing, insatiable demand for animal comforts.

6. Finally, the behavior resulting from these drives is self-destructive and destructive of the planet. As there is still no sign of intelligent life elsewhere in the universe, the future of intelligent life is best served if humanity is changed or replaced by creatures whose natural desires are sustainable with the state of the planet and the general structure of advanced civilization.

Though he never said how he came up with the name, it’s speculated that the name of the company THESIS is based on this doctoral thesis, and intends to act upon its final conclusion and create creatures that would replace the human race.
