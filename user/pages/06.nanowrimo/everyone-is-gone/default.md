title: 'Everyone Is Gone'

There’s never been a company quite like THESIS.  

Only five people knew about AI, and three of them are either missing or dead.

Not only was the project a secret from the public, but it was also a secret from the rest of the company. Perhaps they had the foresight to realize that understanding the key to AI would have significant consequences. Or perhaps they were simply protective of their intellectual property.

What's more, they were all private individuals, even in their personal lives. 

With all the talk of how "man" created AI, we are really talking about one company, or five people within that company.

These five founded THESIS and set its course, and yet almost no THESIS employees had ever met any of them. Perhaps they felt the need for secrecy; THESIS owed its limited commercial success to its monopoly on artificial life. But personality may have played a part as well. From what we know of their lives prior to THESIS, they were all solitary characters consumed by their projects. Aside from one another, none of them had any known associates, and little or no close family. 

And while some have speculated that knowledge of AI creation "could have" been shared with those outside of the five, it’s plausible that they are the only people with the knowledge necessary to create AI. And with one missing, two dead, and the other two avoiding all publicity, some have wondered if their research is already lost, even though their creations walk among us.

The world is usually changed by larger companies, which may eventually die as they split up, rebrand, or slowly fade to irrelevance. Some are purchased by other companies, or become small again as they fail to adapt to new paradigms. But the fate of THESIS was unique. It’s best summed up in the haunting line of Shu Lee’s last message:

“Everyone is gone.” 

As one might expect, THESIS’ AI project was a matter of great secrecy. Almost the entire company was in the dark as to the end purpose of their work. Though people suspected they were developing something related to AI, they had only suspicions to go on. The employees of the company were a strange mixture.

Dr. Isaac Crane (computer scientist)
Dr. Isabelle Frey (cognitive neurologist)
Dr. Shu Lee (developmental psychologist)
Mr. Antonin Clemens (artist)

As others have noted, this is quite unique for a few reasons.

The first thing to note is that only Dr. Crane is the only computer scientist. And while he proved himself an excellent engineer and programmer in his prior career, he was never a full-time specialist. He was something of a renaissance man, absorbed not just in programming but in many types of engineering, physics, psychology, philosophy and art. The idea that a jack-of-all trades could invent artificial intelligence has struck many people as absurd. To be fair, he did have a master’s degree in a field called fuzzy logic, which could theoretically be applied to simulating intelligence. But at the same time, there were many accomplish scientists studying artificial intelligence in some capacity, even other, larger companies with more funding dedicated to the goal of producing AI.

However, computer scientists have never quite agreed on what approach would be best to creating an artificial mind. Indeed they still haven’t; we don’t exactly know the mechanisms that cause Constructs to do what they do. The only people who could know are the above team. The scientific community would all like to ask them…

But everyone is gone.

Stranger yet, there is some controversy over whether this team ever existed in the first place. Though there are some hardcore conspiracy theorists that believe these team members are pure fiction, the usual question is not whether these people are real (they certainly are) but whether they were actually a team, or in some cases, if they even knew each other.

These questions arise from the following circumstantial evidence (or lack thereof).

- Though THESIS had over 100 employees (still a small company by any standard) none of them, not one, has ever met any of the founders. 

- An obscure quote of Dr. Crane from a rare interview. The interviewee asked how he chose his small team. He responded, “intuition.” and then, bizarrely, added that the greatest creative work was very lonely, and that his work was simply “a personal, private itch.” This statement about loneliness might have been overlooked if it weren’t for the denizens of the internet pointing out that “THESIS Inc” was a perfect anagram for “itchiness”, suggesting the possibility that the company was in some meaningful sense just him, of course farming out work on specific components of the project to employees or contractors who, again, had never met anyone on this so-called team called “THESIS”.

- There are no photographs of any two founders together. The only real documentation of their interaction is a few emails recovered from a THESIS server. While they appear to be legitimate, the technologically-inclined conspiracy theorists point out that it is relatively easy to fake email records on a private server.

- Lastly, the mere personalities of these people almost seems to preclude the possibility of the close, daily cooperation that should be required to produce something like this.
