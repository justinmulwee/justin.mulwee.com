title: 'Claire Backstory Trash'

(memory version)

Claire wasn’t born in Vermilion. She had a few memories from another place. It wasn’t Haut, she didn’t think, but it was definitely a brighter place. They were too vague maybe even to be called memories. But she did remember parents. It was more of a memory of their presence. A feeling of being the center of attention of two adults.

The first clear memories she had were of her being carried through the street, people running.

She remembered a place full of confused children. She wasn’t the only one being brought in by a stranger, and asking for her parents.

“This is Claire,” someone said, introducing her to the other children. “Let’s welcome her today. She lost her mom and dad today.”

Fortunately, the orphanage was a good place. That’s where she met Miss Catherine, who she came to think of as her mother. Her real mother soon became someone she barely remembered.


(omniscient version)

A young couple was just sitting down to dinner, when the man looked up from his tablet. “Honey, look at this. Apparently there was some kind of accident at the THESIS factory.”

“Yeah?” She didn’t look up from her task of setting the food out.

There’s some kind of chemical leak, and a bunch of constructs went missing. 

(completely different version)

Claire had only a few memories of her father, but they were fond ones. When he wasn’t at work, he was usually reading, but he never seemed to mind her interruptions.

At some point…

Screw this. i don’t want to write any childhood memories.
