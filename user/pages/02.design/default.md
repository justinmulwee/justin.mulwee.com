I’m a designer at heart. I mention it because I know some designers who are artists at heart — the poor souls. Though I admire fine artists, I better empathize with architects and city planners and industrial designers: people whose art is also invention, people who demand that their work be tested, thrown around and trampled by pedestrians.

I’m a designer because I like problem solving. I don’t mean problems like “How can we convince millennials to buy furniture?” That’s marketing and it’s not what I do. I work out the complicated, practical conundrums of interface design, like

- How can my software simplify someone’s workflow so that the boring parts of their job are removed? 
- Which features of my app are really necessary and why? 
- How can we add more features to an already cluttered app, yet make it seem simpler, yet make sure no one is confused, yet enable power users to work very quickly?

If your problems are of that nature, I’m your man. I analyze software and web projects, help clarify their purpose and concept, and then create detailed interface designs to bring them to their potential. In short, I help close the gap between what things do and why they exist.
