After a brief hesitation, she hit the send button.

> can i come over

> just saw this. sure.

She came in and plopped down next to him on the couch. Her bony frame collapsed into the cushions with sudden force. She wore a black t-shirt with pink text: Cute but Psycho. 

After a moment of silence, she spoke. 

I met my new doctor today. I hate men. When I came in, he was eating Chinese food and had his feet on the desk. He made fun of my shirt. He said, you shouldn’t advertise that about yourself. I said, it’s just a shirt. I have to be able to laugh at myself. He said it’s just going to make other people laugh at you. He asked me if there was abuse. I said yeah there was some abuse. With my ex boyfriend. Mostly emotional abuse. He just said, well, you picked him.

Whats so terrible about men?

You can’t trust them.

Yeah? Why not?

I don’t want to discuss it with you.

The two sat on the couch quietly for a moment before she spoke again. Could you make some tea?

Sure.

She had just taken her anti-anxiety medicine and was getting drowsy. She sipped her tea, and then curled up in a fetal position in the corner of the couch.

Do you want a blanket? he said.

Yes.
